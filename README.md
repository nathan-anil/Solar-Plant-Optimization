# Solar-Plant-Optimization
Non-renewable energy generation is both degrading to the Earth and non-sustainable. The purpose of this project is to optimize renewable energy generation so that leading energy sources can be switched to renewable energy. Renewable energy grid stability depends on a balance between energy supply and energy demand. If the demand exceeds the supply, then the area supplied by the power plant will experience energy shortages/blackouts. However, if the supply exceeds the demand, then the power plant will incur heavy costs due to the wasted energy. Because renewable energy sources depend on environmental conditions, the supply is highly variable. This project aims to create a polynomial regression model to predict the energy supply of a renewable energy power plant, allowing energy grids to be more efficient and economical. The machine learning model was programmed in python from scratch. The model was trained on a solar radiation dataset, taking in environmental conditions and time/date data. The accuracy of the model was just seven percent. To achieve a more accurate model, numerous optimizations to the model were applied including feature engineering, finding the optimal learning rate, and the Bayes Information Criterion. After these optimizations, a final accuracy of eighty-six percent was achieved.
